# LIHC Project

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) data. The goal of this project is to explore clinical, molecular, and genomic features of LIHC datasets, generating visualizations, statistics, and insights that may improve understanding of liver cancer.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to clean, filter, and normalize LIHC data.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and basic modeling.
- **Visualization:** Generation of plots and charts (e.g., survival curves, heatmaps).
- **Reproducible Workflows:** Notebook- or script-based pipelines to reproduce results.

## Project Structure
A typical layout for the repository might be:
```
LIHC-project/
├─ data/               # Raw and processed data files
├─ scripts/            # Standalone data processing scripts
├─ notebooks/          # Jupyter (or R) notebooks for exploratory analysis
├─ results/            # Outputs from analyses (figures, tables)
├─ figures/            # Visualizations generated by the scripts/notebooks
├─ README.md           # Project documentation (you are here!)
└─ LICENSE             # License information (if applicable)
```

> **Note:** File organization may differ from what you see above. Adjust as needed if your repository has a different structure.

## Requirements
- **Python >= 3.X** (or **R** if the analysis uses R scripts)
- Common data science libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`)  
  *OR*  
  Common R packages (e.g., `tidyverse`, `survival`, `ggplot2`)  
- [Optional] Additional libraries for statistical analysis or plotting.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koehlek99/LIHC-project.git
   cd LIHC-project
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install packages as needed (if a `requirements.txt` is not yet provided).

---

## Usage
1. **Prepare input data**  
   - Ensure required datasets are placed in the `data/` directory, or specify their paths in your scripts or notebooks.

2. **Run analysis**  
   - Check the `scripts/` folder or relevant notebooks to see how to run analyses. For example:
     ```bash
     python scripts/preprocess_data.py
     python scripts/analyze_data.py
     ```
     Or open any Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/`:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook notebooks/survival_analysis.ipynb
     ```

3. **View results**  
   - Generated figures or tables will appear in the `results/` or `figures/` folders.
